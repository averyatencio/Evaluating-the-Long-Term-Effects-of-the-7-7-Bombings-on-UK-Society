# Societal-Resilience-and-Trust-Evaluating-the-Long-Term-Effects-of-the-7-7-Bombings-on-UK-Society
On July 7th, 2005, the United Kingdom (UK) faced a violent attack resulting in significant losses and public distress. This paper examines the long-term effects of the 7/7 bombings on life satisfaction, attitudes towards “outgroups”, and institutional trust within the UK. Utilizing data from the European Social Survey (ESS) from 2002-2008, we employ the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) to create a counterfactual London, analyzing the bombings’ effects. We also developed an Average Treatment Effect (ATT) analysis to complement the analysis, acknowledging methodological limitations, along with a zonal Difference-in- Differences analysis. Our findings reveal non-significant positive effects on overall wellbeing, a higher importance placed on safety, positive shifts in perceptions towards immigrants, and general institutional satisfaction and trust. However, our results show a decreased interest in politics and an initial decrease in trust towards the United Nations and the police. These insights contribute to the understanding the long-term effects of an attack on societal responses following 7/7 bombings.
